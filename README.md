# @marp-team/pptx

A wrapper module for creating PPTX using [PptxGenJS](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS), with the least module size.

- It includes only required files and dependencies for working PptxGenJS in Node (or module bundler).
- User-friendly entry point (CommonJS default export and better TypeScript definition)

## Usage

```javascript
import PPTX from '@marp-team/pptx'

const pptx = new PPTX()
```

Refer to [PptxGenJS documentation](https://gitbrent.github.io/PptxGenJS/docs/usage-pres-create.html) how to use.
